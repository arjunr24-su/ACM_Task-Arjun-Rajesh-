# Django Ecommerce Security Review

I took a look at the Django Ecommerce project and found some security issues that we should fix.

## Security Issues

### 1. SQL Injection
SQL injection happens when user input is directly included in SQL queries without proper sanitization. This can allow attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands.

**Potential Issues:**
- Directly using user input in SQL queries without parameterization.

**Example:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = '%s'" % product_name)
```

**Recommendations:**
- Use Django's ORM to handle database queries, which automatically escapes inputs.
- Avoid using raw SQL queries. If necessary, use parameterized queries.

**Fix:**
```python
cursor.execute("SELECT * FROM products WHERE name = %s", [product_name])
```

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
XSS attacks involve injecting malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users. This can happen if user input is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the browser.

**Potential Issues:**
- Displaying user-generated content without escaping HTML characters.

**Example:**
```html
{{ user_input }}
```

**Recommendations:**
- Use Django's built-in template system, which escapes HTML by default.
- Avoid using `mark_safe` or `safe` unless absolutely necessary and ensure the input is sanitized.

**Fix:**
```html
{{ user_input|escape }}
```

### 3. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)
CSRF attacks trick users into submitting requests unknowingly. Django provides built-in protection against CSRF attacks, but it must be properly implemented.

**Potential Issues:**
- Missing CSRF tokens in forms.
- Disabling CSRF protection in views.

**Example:**
```html
<form method="post">
```

**Recommendations:**
- Ensure all forms include `{% csrf_token %}`.
- Avoid disabling CSRF protection unless absolutely necessary and understand the risks involved.

**Fix:**
```html
<form method="post">{% csrf_token %}
```
